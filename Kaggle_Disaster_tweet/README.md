This is a NLP problem, hosted over Kaggle platform which consisted of solving a NLP problem. It contained data gathered from various tweets of various users, utilizing which a NLP model was to be designed which could classify weather those tweets are related to real disaster or not.
I have used 2 approaches:
  - Machine learning : Here I have made use of sklearn libray. I have used TF-IDF for word embedding and then used logistic regression and bagging classifier
  -	Deep Learning : Here I have made use of the word2vec embeddings and RNN model.
